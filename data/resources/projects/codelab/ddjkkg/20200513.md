# notes for 20200513

let's get a little more systematic with our notes docs now. this will make it a bit easier to turn this into a tutorial some day.

So for right now I'll break things down first by bullets of what we did last time and what we should try for this time (and we can load up "next time" with a wish list.)

## last time
1. installed the airtable module with `npm i airtable`
2. listed the contents of an airtable table at the `/airtable` route
3. learned more about how the files of the express app are linked together
4. created a simple `ejs` template that displays `json` data
5. learned the very useful `JSON.stringify` method

## this time

I think maybe the next steps are these:

1. understand `req.params`
2. get and display a specified record at `/airtable/:record_id`
3. start to understand JS [data types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp):
    * strings
    * numbers
    * arrays
    * objects
    * booleans
    * dates (which is just an object not its own type, but a special object we'll use a lot)

## next time
1. maybe work on styling this stuff and handling loops in the ejs
2. maybe use a `cli.js` file and `npm link` to create commands?
3. maybe work on shell scripting at some point? or using child process to open up stuff in the terminal?
4. anything else?
