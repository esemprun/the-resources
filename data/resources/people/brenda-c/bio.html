      Biography
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Brenda (they/them/theirs) and I am a rising sophomore
      proudly reprsenting Adams House. I plan to concentrate in Romance
      Languages and Literature or Sociology. At Harvard, I am involved with
      <a href="https://ohcdb.squarespace.com/" title="Our Harvard Can Do Better"
        >Our Harvard Can Do Better</a
      >, Harvard Black Students Association,
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HarvardESC/" title="Facebook page"
        >Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition</a
      >, and the Learning Lab! I have been working for the Bok Center since the
      fall of my freshman year. The Learning Lab is one of my favorite places at
      Harvard. At the Lab, I enjoy studying how art and creative projects can be
      incoprated into course assignments. I also am interested in researching
      the workflows of students from various fields of study to create resource
      guides for incoming first-year students. Whether on-campus or over Zoom,
      the Learning Lab is a place where I can tap into my creativity,
      collaborate and learn from talented LLUFs, and brainstorm projects to
      improve the classroom experience, as our learning environments are rapidly
      being transformed.
