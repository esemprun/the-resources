### Biography

Hello! My name is Brenda (they/them/theirs) and I am a rising sophomore proudly reprsenting Adams House. I plan to concentrate in Romance Languages and Literature or Sociology. At Harvard, I am involved with [Our Harvard Can Do Better](https://ohcdb.squarespace.com/ "Our Harvard Can Do Better"), Harvard Black Students Association, [Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition](https://www.facebook.com/HarvardESC/ "Facebook page"), and the Learning Lab! I have been working for the Bok Center since the fall of my freshman year. The Learning Lab is one of my favorite places at Harvard. At the Lab, I enjoy studying how art and creative projects can be incoprated into course assignments. I also am interested in researching the workflows of students from various fields of study to create resource guides for incoming first-year students. Whether on-campus or over Zoom, the Learning Lab is a place where I can tap into my creativity, collaborate and learn from talented LLUFs, and brainstorm projects to improve the classroom experience, as our learning environments are rapidly being transformed.
