# The Story of StudioLab

Meeting every Wednesday (and the *occasional* Thursday) evening, the Learning Lab becomes a dedicated space to StudioLab.
StudioLab started out as a time that anyone who was interested in being creative could come together and reimagine the ways in which the Learning Lab was set up. When courses needed something different from the space, StudioLab stepped in to save the day. Whether a stage needed creating or a new backdrop was requested, members of StudioLab would work to come up with creative solutions to such tasks. StudioLab quickly evolved into a time that anyone who was interested in exploring their creativity outside of the regular labs could do so; often resulting in **amazing projects and designs.** As more courses requested the help of the Learning Lab, members of StudioLab began to channel their creative energies into the innovative ideas of course heads. Concepts which were once wishful thinking soon became a reality; courses would "pitch" their ideas to StudioLab, and members would help craft these ideas into incredible tools for learning.

### 09/01/19: Marlon's Solution to the "Gray Zone"... the Birth of StudioLab
> With StudioLab originally being imagined as a way to redesign the space, its first impact originated as a happy accident. The plain gray wall at the back of the Learning lab had always irked Marlon, but a temporary position to lean a magnetic board presented us with a permanent solution.

### 09/01/19: Brick Room Becomes Computer Room
> Another *temporary* change by Marlon gains popularity and becomes **permanent.** The room adjacent to the main studio became the hub for desktop PCs; an incredibly convenient location for those editing images/footage in real-time.

### 09/18/19: Truss, Tables and Talent!
> On our very first *official* StudioLab, the tables and truss were rearranged to create what would be the first iteration 
of our 2019/20 Learning Lab! In the background, you can also see the very beginning of the chalk wall. A preliminary outline 
was sketched out, laying the foundations for what turned out to be a staple of the Learning Lab this year!

## *October 2019:* The Month of the Chalk Wall
> The majority of October's StudioLabs were dedicated to populating the large, blank chalk wall which spanned across the entire Learning Lab. Knowing that this would inevitably be the backdrop for many shoots throughout the year, StudioLab members Connor and Jordan spent time designing the wall before getting to work on bringing their ideas to life.

## *November 2019*
### EMR 135 - Climate Migration: Histories, Borders, and Activism
> In November, we started our work with EMR 135. The class had many objectives it wanted to achieve over the course of the semester. At the Learning Lab, we focused on creating a physical tree that could be utilized in a workshop for students to interact with, each with their own project in mind. At the very beginning of December, we hosted their final event in the Learning Lab, setting up the tree and other resources for the students to use.

## Other November Projects

### 19th November: "Video Capture: Composition + Storytelling"
### 20th November: "FCPX Video Editing Basics, Montages, 3 Minute Stories"

## *December 2019*

### 12/10/19: The Learning Lab Winter Gallery
> Back in December, the Learning Lab hosted its annual Winter Galley, presenting the effort and work that had been produced by members throughout the Fall semester. For such an event to be successful, the space of the main studio needed to be changed once again. Not only this, but we had to figure out the where each project would be situated, and how it was going to be presented to those visiting the Learning Lab. The Gallery was a huge success; guests from across the university came to view our work and to celebrate the end of the semester with us.

## *January 2020*

### 01/30/20: The 1000:1 Project
### Chalk Art

## *February 2020*
### 02/24/20: The Parker Quartet
> Earlier this year, the Learning Lab had the pleasure of hosting the Grammy Award-winning Parker Quartet for an inspiring performance. The main studio space within the Learning Lab had to be reimagined for such an event; a total reconfiguration of the tables and truss was required. Enter StudioLab! Members of StudioLab loved the challenge of figuring out the solution. Not only did the setup need to be visually appealing, but the acoustics had to be inch-perfect and the final arrangement had to be practical, taking into account the many cables and cameras that were required to record the performance. Furthermore, our setup had to be in harmony with what the Parker Quartet were comfortable with, as they have already have a setup that they are familiar with.
