## The Story

LLUFs come from all across the college, some starting freshman fall, while others join essentialsLab their senior spring. We set out to explore how LLUFs find the Learning Lab, and, no surprise, we discovered that many came to visit with one of their classes and then stuck around. When we asked them more about that experience, it revealed something powerful about the Learning Lab: no one ever wants to leave. 

The lab is definitely a striking visual. Upon walking in, all of the students describe wonder and excitement. LLUF Emmy S writes:

“I thought (and still think!) the Learning Lab was the coolest place I had ever been to … from the colorful stools to the chalkboard wall to the trusses and live-recording monitors. I just remember thinking this is such a creative space, and I am so happy to be here.” 

LLUFs describe it as a place they want to spend time, both because of its aesthetics and also because of its staff. Most LLUFs met Marlon, Jordan, or Katie during their workshops, and all of them described the staff as “more than happy to help,” “genuinely interested in your work,” and “cheerful and supportive.”

And of course, each of the workshops were exciting and engaging, 

Many of the LLUFs decided to apply almost immediately after their workshops, but others had different moments of reckoning, like Emmy S, who visited with her Expos 20 class Journey to Mars, and then later rediscovered the lab at a student job fair and reflected back on her class experience. Regardless of the timing, all of the LLUFs were so excited to apply and reflected that their first impression of the position was that it was designed so that their work would matter, they would learn exciting and important tools, and they could grow as people and students. Working at the Learning Lab felt like more than just a way to make money in college: it was also an opportunity to be creative, to take risks, and to explore new things. 

Now, after a least a semester of work for all of the LLUFs,
