1.    What class did you first come to the Learning Lab with, and what term?

I joined the Learning Lab after visiting it for MCB 81 in Fall 2017, back when the Lab used to be based in the Science Center!

2.    What activities did you work on while you were in the Learning Lab?

For our class, we needed to make presentational videos for certain research papers/proposals, rather than traditional essays and exams. We used the Learning Lab’s resources to create our materials (e.g. any visuals we needed to aid our discussions), and then booked time in to rehearse our ~25-minute presentations. Once happy, we were booked in to film the real thing! The whole presentation had to be filmed in one continuous shoot, and we were given a couple of chances to record it.

3.    What was your first impression of the Learning Lab?

I remember thinking what an incredible space the Learning Lab was – bearing in mind this was back in the Science Center. If only I could have known what it would become today! Of course, it wasn’t quite as artsy as it is now, but it definitely exceeded all of my expectations; I loved the art supplies everywhere and the bursts of colour around all of the rooms.

4.    Who did you meet from the Learning Lab during your first class visit(s) there?

I remember meeting Marlon and Katie on my first day there - I would always pester Katie for assignments to work on, and she would always provide them!

5.    When did you decide to apply to be a LLUF?

I decided to apply as soon as I found out it was possible. At the end of my first class visit, Marlon mentioned to the class that if anyone was interested in working at the Learning Lab they should speak to him. As everyone left the class, I hung around so I could catch him – I was unsure if it was possible due to me being an international student, but he assured me it did not matter. He quickly set me up with Katie to have a chat - fast forward 3 years, and here we are!

6.    What factors went into making the decision to apply?

I knew I needed an on-campus job, but I really wanted to find something that I enjoyed. I’d already worked many part-time jobs in the UK where I dreaded going in every day, and so I was hoping to finally find something different. From the beginning, I could tell that the Learning Lab would be this place. I’d never had the opportunity to be paid to be creative, and I couldn’t believe that this was a real possibility on campus! I also really wanted to work in a place which valued my work; somewhere it would have a real impact.

7.    What other classes have you taken that you wished would have utilized the Learning Lab?

CULTBLF 34: Madness and Medicine

PSY 1304: Cognitive Neuropsychology

MCB 186: Sleep and Circadian Clocks

ASTRON 1: The Big Questions of Astronomy

AFRAMER 119X: Chocolate, Culture, and Politics

8.    Is there anything you wish the Learning Lab could have done differently with your class?

I think the Learning Lab did a phenomenal job with my class, especially given their limited resources in the Science Center. There’s nothing I can think of that they could have done better, but I know for sure that we would have had even more opportunities in the current space!

9.    If you could choose one thing that stood out the most from your first visit, what would it be?

It sounds cliché, but the thing that stood out the most was the kindness of those who worked there. All staff members were always more than happy to help; this is something I’d never really experienced as a student. You kind of just assume that people don’t have a genuine interest in your work and perhaps even think that your creative ideas are “silly.” Instead, at the Learning Lab, everyone encouraged these ideas and even helped me generate more of them – I knew that this was the kind of place I wanted to work outside of my own classes.

10. How could the class that brought you to the Learning Lab utilize it in a remotely based world?

Any tutorials/help on video cutting/editing would be the best thing if MCB 81 was being taken now. We would have to record our presentations at home (which shouldn’t be too much of an issue), but I imagine it would be great to have help on editing the film and putting the final video together. Without access to physical resources to make visuals, perhaps even tutorials on animations etc. would be useful! I imagine it would be about finding a balance between the student being able to create what they have in mind and having enough time to do so.


### Emmy S

1.    What class did you first come to the Learning Lab with, and what term?

I first came to the Learning Lab through Expos 20: Journey to Mars, which I took my freshman fall (2018).

2. What activities did you work on while you were in the Learning Lab?

Our professor, Ramyar, was always going above and beyond to take learning outside of the classroom, from viewing parties to museum trips, the class was very interactive. I’m so thankful that he created that experience for us, it was such a great welcome to courses at Harvard, but I’m most thankful that he brought us into the Learning Lab. We went twice for this course, but the first time was an analysis of the movie “The Martian”. We came in and the Learning Lab staff had cut frame-by-frame shots of the first 5 minutes of the movie and had them laid out across multiple tables. As groups, we picked certain scenes out that we felt explained one of the central themes of the plot and cinematography that we had discussed in class. We also used green colored paper to greenscreen the movie onto it and write on it during our presentation, which is still one of my favorite tools in the Learning Lab. It opened up a whole new world of ways to analyze and discuss media that left me feeling really excited about writing my expos paper.

3. What was your first impression of the Learning Lab?

I thought (and still think!) the Learning Lab was the coolest place I had ever been to. The space itself is just so incredible, from the colorful stools to the chalkboard wall to the trusses and live-recording monitors, I just remember thinking this is such a creative space and I am so happy to be here. One of the thoughts that popped in to my head on that first day was “everyone needs to know about this place”. It was my first semester freshman year and I still wish I had found the Learning Lab sooner. I spent all week telling my friends about how much I loved it and what I had done with my class there. I still think the Learning Lab is an amazing, wonderful, creative space and resource that should be a part of every student’s time at Harvard.

4. Who did you meet from the Learning Lab during your first class visit(s) there?

Marlon was leading the workshop so I know I met him that first day. Casey was recording, but I wasn’t actually introduced to him until I started as a LLUF.

5. When did you decide to apply to be a LLUF?

I accidentally went to a job fair in the spring of my freshman year (I was going to study with my friends in the Oasis at Memorial Church and didn’t know there was a job fair going on). I decided to walk around anyways since I was starting to settle in at Harvard and had thought about a campus job. I ended up interviewing at the end of my freshman spring and starting as a LLUF in the summer.

6. What factors went into making the decision to apply?

I met Katie! She was at the Learning Lab table of the job fair and I was telling her all about my experience and how much I loved getting to visit through my expos class and she was so welcoming and excited with me, I knew I had to apply.

7. What other classes have you taken that you wished would have utilized the Learning Lab?

I genuinely think every class would benefit from the Learning Lab (in my incredibly biased opinion). I think a lot of the project-based classes I’ve take in particular could really use our resources:

FRES SEM 35: Latin American Literature

HAA11: Landmarks of World Architecture

ES51: Computer Aided Machine Design

ES54: Electronics for Engineers

8. Is there anything you wish the Learning Lab could have done differently with your class?

I loved the workshop we did for the class as it was. I would’ve loved if we had continued visiting the Learning Lab when we got into the virtual reality module of the course because I know we could’ve done a more interactive workshop on it.

9. If you could choose one thing that stood out the most from your first visit, what would it be?

The fact that we were being filmed the whole time was so exciting to me. I felt like I was in a movie or something, telling a story with the work I was presenting.

10. How could the class that brought you to the Learning Lab utilize it in a remotely-based world?

A huge part of Journey to Mars was our class trips to the observatory/museums/VR lab, so I think the course could use a lot of help transitioning to remote learning. Hosting zoom workshops through gamelab like the in-person one we had later in the course would be very helpful. Also, any kind of story analysis workshops, both textual and film, would be useful.



### Kai F

1.. What class did you first come to the Learning Lab with, and what term?

	I was first introduced to the learning lab through Expos20: Narrating Immigration during Fall 2019.

2. What activities did you work on while you were in the Learning Lab?

	Our focus was on developing our storytelling skills for our end of the year capstone project. We spent our first session breaking down our tales into key points on post-its and then practiced telling those stories to others in the class.
  
3. What was your first impression of the Learning Lab?

	The space itself exuded a sort of creative drive in its design. I walked in and immediately felt like interacting and experimenting with different things.
  
4. Who did you meet from the Learning Lab during your first class visit(s) there?

	Jordan was our instructor for the storytelling tutorial so I got to really experience a genuine Learning Lab workshop. I believe Casey was also there throughout filming, but we largely only interacted with Jordan.
  
5. When did you decide to apply to be a LLUF?

	Almost immediately after my class’s workshop. Jordan had advertised the LLUF position during our workshop and I knew that I wanted to be a part of it.
  
6. What factors went into making the decision to apply?

	The job itself is very project-oriented and collaborative. I knew that I would never get bored of working there and it was very flexible and understanding of the university lifestyle.
  
7. What other classes have you taken that you wished would have utilized the Learning Lab?

	Literally every course at Harvard could benefit from utilizing the Learning Lab, but my AFVS course Intro to Still Photography would have made for some amazing projects. A combination of the two would make for interesting edits and compositions.
  
8. Is there anything you wish the Learning Lab could have done differently with your class?

	I’m likely very biased from my experience with the Lab, but I would have enjoyed more practice and examples of telling stories in front of the camera and how actions, tone, and diction really help to develop the tale. Because of the nature of the class, however, we were very limited on time in regards to the capstone project.
  
9. If you could choose one thing that stood out the most from your first visit, what would it be?

	The workshop was expertly integrated into the content of our course and I could tell that many of the students gained a lot of insight into how to best express themselves in front of people and cameras. 
  
10. How could the class that brought you to the Learning Lab utilize it in a remotely-based world?

	I think that the format we utilized in house could very easily be adapted to a remote-teaching lesson. Additionally, I think it could go further and teach students how to edit and compose their own video narratives to tell their stories as opposed to a more monologue style of storytelling.

### Kylie S

1. What class did you first come to the Learning Lab with, and what term?

I first came to the Learning Lab with Expos20 Sexism and Politics in Fall 2019. 

2. What activities did you work on while you were in the Learning Lab?

We actually came to the Learning Lab on  two separate occasions. The first was to make a podcast about some of the topics we had been discussing in class. The second time was helping us design a poster, in which we did a workshop on how to use Canva.

3. What was your first impression of the Learning Lab?

It seemed like a really creative and happy place. It was a really intriguing place and I was curious to learn more about what goes on there. 

4. Who did you meet from the Learning Lab during your first class visit(s) there?

I honestly don’t remember and I’m sad about it. Maybe when we’re back on campus I can ask to go through old footage of the days I visited to see who was there. 

5. When did you decide to apply to be a LLUF?

I decided to apply to be a LLUF during my second visit because they were handing out business cards with directions on how to apply. Before then, I didn’t realize it was an opportunity for undergraduates.

6. What factors went into making the decision to apply?

My dad had to work throughout college to afford tuition, so it was important to him that I wouldn’t be in the same position. He told me that I could get a job if I wanted to, but only if I felt I was getting more out of it than just money. As soon as I found out the Learning Lab was hiring, I knew I had to apply because I could tell I would get so much out of it. It felt like such a great community that would give me an opportunity to explore things I wouldn’t otherwise. I normally don’t really consider myself a creative person and I knew the Learning Lab would be a place I could develop those skills. Everyone that I met there also seemed happy and cheerful, which suggested that working with them would be a great experience. 

7. What other classes have you taken that you wished would have utilized the Learning Lab?

I think it would have been really cool if my freshman seminar on Transformative Ideas in Brain Science had utilized the Learning Lab. It was a small class, but it was difficult to stay engaged because it mostly consisted of doing some readings and then discussing them in class. I think the Learning Lab could have helped the professor approach the material in a more creative way that was more engaging and exciting. 

8. Is there anything you wish the Learning Lab could have done differently with your class?

I enjoyed my experience at the Learning Lab because the workshop was quite organized and polished, but I still felt like I had creative freedom. The team gave the perfect amount of directions, so I knew what I was doing, but still felt like I could express myself. 

9. If you could choose one thing that stood out the most from your first visit, what would it be?

What stood out the most for me was the energy of the Learning Lab. Everyone seemed cheerful and supportive and the space felt magical. It’s difficult to describe, but I knew the space and the community was special right away. 

10. How could the class that brought you to the Learning Lab utilize it in a remotely-based world?

I think the same workshops we did in person could be adjusted to the remote environment. The poster-making on Canva would probably be the easiest because that medium is already online. The podcast workshop would be more difficult, but I think it would be possible. It could be turned into something similar to how news channels have streamed from their homes. There would have to be a protocol for filming from home, but I think it could still happen.
