# Trimming a video using Quicktime or the native Photos app on Windows 10

Trimming the beginning or end of a video is very easy to do on either a PC or a Mac, using applications that are more than likely already installed on your machine. Here is how to do it.

If you recorded through Zoom, first you'll need to download your video from Canvas:

  * Click on "Zoom"
  * Click on "Cloud Recordings"
  * Click on the correct recording
  * Click the "Download" icon associated with that file

  * This will give two handles at the beginning and end of the video. You can drag these to where you’d ideally like the video to start and end.

  * Once you’ve selected the range you’re hoping to show, hit “Save As” in the top right hand corner, and choose a location to save it.
