## Sophie B:
Hi! My name is Sophie Bauder. I've been a LLUf since March of 2018 so I've passed my two year anniversary, which is so exciting! This is my reflection for Distance Lab for my Distance Diary about this past year of LLUFing and also my experience with it in total. 

Generally, what keeps me going as a LLUF in terms of interest in learning is often learning new skills or taking on new tasks. I'm definitely someone who is very challenge driven. I think that's what brought me to coding within the Learning Lab and picking up those skills in particular because, not only were they so new to me, but they were such a challenge. You did end up with a deliverable at the end of the day which you could be super proud of, and there were certain steps along the way that you had to fulfill to get there. So it was this, sort of, stage by stage way of learning that almost felt like a competition or game show with myself that kept me super engaged the whole way through. Sort of through this method of learning I've been able to pick up skills in React this semester, in Java Script more in general, in HTML, in CSS, in Python — even coding in working with video clips and videos. All of that has been such a blessing to get to do at the Learning Lab, in part because of the incredible staff and all the other LLUFS who have helped so much with any difficulties — of which I had many as I was learning to code, as anyone who was at the lab while I was working on a project would for sure know. 

Something else that the Learning Lab has brought into my life and that I am *so* grateful for from the perspective of my time as a LLUF is the lesson that you can learn almost as much from teaching as you can from actually attending a workshop or attending a class. I never would have thought that the most I would learn in terms of how to code, for example, would come from the time I spent making tutorials, teaching other beginner coders how to pick up their own skills. That has been such an important lesson! One that I am so grateful for and one that I very much credit the learning lab with teaching me. 

One other thing I am *so* grateful for is just the community and the love that comes from the Bok Center. My standards for work places will forever be so high because of this job and I often say it's one of the very best things to happen to me in college — and that is *not* an exaggeration. The friendship and support that is present at the Learning Lab is honestly unaparalled in most other spaces — I would hazard to say in the world, not just at Harvard. I would say that, while of course the skills I've picked up are really important at the Lab, so are just the connections that I've made and the people that I've met and the incredible things I've learned from *them* outside of Photoshop or coding or whatever: how to communicate things you care about, how to meet new people, how to put yourself outside of your comfort zone, and things like that. 

All in all, I can safely say that being a LLUF is one of my favorite parts of my college life and I think it will remain that until the day I graduate. I'm so grateful that this semester, despite all of the insane uncertainty and the difficult circumstances, that Bok was able to remain a consistent presence in my life. That was definitely — and I think most LLUFs will say the same — a super important part of the process of adapting to this new reality. I can't express enough how much love I have for the Bok Center and how grateful I am to get to spend so many wonderful hours a week here in the virtual studio or, hopefully, one day again back in the real one.

Hello! So, I have decided to film this without putting a lot of thought into the questions before hand because I want it to be what I think in the moment and just like a genuine answer, so hopefully this won't be a mess!

"What inspires me to learn?"
I think I have kind of two answers. One, super generally just in life, I've always thought this and it's the reason I want to teach and the reason why I love the Learning Lab and helping teachers is that I think learning is... my life goal is just to be learning all the time and I think it gives my life purpose. I think that it's because, at the end of the day, when my life ends, not to get super grim but, when my life ends I'm going to look back and think about if I learned every single day and if I knew all these things at the end of the day, then I would know I lived a really really happy life. I feel that way because I think of how we're learning in textbooks now, and I am just like, 'wow, when this was written....' Like, we take these things for granted. We're like, 'oh yea Newton's law,' but like, he had to figure those out! It's one of those things we're he only figured them out because he was going off of what other people had done before him. In order to get to the point where we can advance we first need to understand enough in the field and what's going on so I think learning is the most important thing we do. I don't think we ever stop and I don't think we ever learn just one thing or whatever we major in. 

Specifically in my major, I'm super super inspired to learn because when I first learned physics in high school, I just found my way of describing the world. I kept looking for it in English, because that's the obvious one like, you can describe the world in words, or poetry, or art. And I did [find it] in some ways, I feel like I do tell stories with dance and everything, but I feel like when I finally took physics I found a way that made sense to me for describing the world and I thought that was so cool and so different. I think that's what inspires me to keep going. Like, if I'm sitting in a chair and I lean back I know exactly the angle at which I'm going to fall, and it's a silly example but it's stuff like that that [make me] absolutlely love what I do. I think engineering is such a cool way of seeing the world and that's why I, presently as a college student, concentrate in engineering. That's what keeps me motivated every day to learn. 

"How do you think your work as a LLUF has evolved?"
I think my time as a LLUF has... I'm just a whole different person from when I started, at least I think so. I was definitely the type of person who like, I don't know. I've never really been the "creative" one in my family or even with my friends. I love dance and that's always been my way of expressing myself creatively, but I wasn't the one to edit a video or take a picture. My sister is a graphic designer and she's absolutely incredible, and we just always acknowledge that we are both really talented in very different ways. The Learning Lab has given me this platform to be a beginner and to learn these things. You don't have to be a certain type of person to know these things and to learn about them and to care about them. I genuinely did [care about them], and I still do, and I didn't even know until I got a chance to give it a try. 

Now, I'm so proud of myself. If I want to edit something out of a photo I'm like, 'Oh, I know Photoshop!' It's little things like that. I went into the Learning Lab because obviously I love learning and I really want to teach.... And it makes sense. It's not just the Learning Lab because we help other people learn, because we are also constantly learning and that's *how* we help other people. It's just such a beautiful, amazing, magical, wonderful, inspiring space that I'm so happy and proud to be a part of. Even remotely, even when the physical space isn't there, it's been such a welcoming space and my favorite space on campus! I think I've really grown as a LLUF. I've tried things that I didn't think I would, and I'm really happy with my experience so far, and excited to see where it goes next!

Hi, I'm Kathryn. I'm a junior at Harvard and this video is me reflecting on one year now of being a LLUF.

When I first came in, I had heard about Bok, I had done some work with them through my other clubs. They helped me film a video and I just remember coming into the space and thinking that there was really nothing else like it on campus. I couldn't believe that this building just *existed* on Church Street and looked like a movie set and an artist's studio just put together. It was such a colorful and vibrant space and people were *so* full of energy and knew so much about *everything*! Every single technology and creative form that there was, there seemed to be someone who just really knew what was going on. As someone who, you know, back when I was studying economics for the most part, I didn't really consider myself then to be that much of a creative person, but at the same time I couldn't help but feel that this place was super cool and that everyone that I met that worked there just had amazing things to say and it really just piqued my interest. 

Coming in, my first few weeks, it was definitely an interesting experience to gain my grounding. There's so many workshops that I realized just went on, and I hadn't even realized that the Bok Center was helping seminars and they helped classes produce products and assignments with cool media and Adobe tools. I had no idea that this was part of the work that they did, so I was just blown away by the amount of tutorials being produced, and also just by the quality of the content that I was testing. It was all really cool, unique, innovative ways to think about teaching. That was a new concept and a new topic of thinking about how *I* would want to learn ideally. It was something that I didn't spend that much time thinking about but now after a year of being constantly at the forefront of everything that the Bok community does... I think that has overall enhanced just so much of my academic experience. Honestly, I think that it made me a more creative person. 

It definitely helped me gain confidence through doing a bunch of projects in coding, having so many experts in there just on-hand, in the lab. I sort of just slowly made my way into the world of Computer Science. Now, especially after this past semester, starting to work on a lot more Adobe software, sort of piqued my interest in design. This summer, me and a friend are planning to hold each other accountable and we're going to try to build creative portfolios and just see where it takes us. We're going to be seniors and it's now or never to pursue one's passions and so why not? 

I've definitely felt that I've been super supported by the Bok Center to learn whatever I want to learn and also just having the ability to welcome the unexpected. One of the tools that now I think is so cool and I've done a decent amount of work in is animation and I don't think I would have ever fallen down that track if I didn't just come in one day and there had been an animation tutorial going on. I sat in and I just found that I really loved the intricacies of animating a walk cycle and just thinking about the human form.... I thought that was so fascinating. And now, cut to, I've done a whole project with Adobe Animate... and I just can't help but hope. 

I wish that in my first two years that I had seen more of Bok, and I just honestly wish that all those tutorials, their hackathons, their workshops, could be made even more prevalent throughout the Harvard community because I truly believe that, even if you're not a LLUF, you could totally benefit from doing a workshop here and being exposed and being sort of thrown off. I think that Bok encourages you in the best possible way to get out of your comfort zone and do something unexpected. I think that that tends to bring out the best in me and the best in a lot of students who, you know, are involved with the community. Overall, I would credit Bok with inspiring me to do and pursue a lot of things that I'm passionate about. And I'm very glad about that and very grateful for all the support that I've recieved along the way this past year.
