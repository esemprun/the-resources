#The Gened 1080 Story

##Our Goal
Before Gened1080 was Gened 1080, it was a SEAS class, an engineering elective for students involved in a technical field. This fall was its first semester as a general education course, so our main goal in helping this course was opening it up to a general audience. Our involvement was centered around making the material more accessible and approachable for students coming from different backgrounds of knowledge, both in engineering and music. It wasn’t just about the math being too technical, there was also complex music theory and composition involved in the course that’s technical in its own way. Bridging these two subjects together and creating a level playing field in both of them was our overarching goal in creating content. Since then, our goals for 1080 grew as the semester progressed, including creating a brand for the course, documenting student's work, and setting a precedent for materials used in future semesters.


## Toolkit

### The idea

Over the summer, we started working with Rob to come up with modules of concepts in math and music that students coming into the class would need a refresher or crash course on. We started by recording and editing videos of Rob explaining those modules, creating subsections and cropping the video for different concepts and used that to start building what would eventually become the full tool kit. Since the videos gave more of an extensive overview of the material, we added a written component to each module that gives students the general idea of what is covered in that section, to help them decide if they knew enough about the topic already or need to go more in depth in their review. Finally, we added some visual elements to each of the written descriptions through hand-drawn graphics, to show any concept that was hard to explain in plain test.

### What could be added or improved
* Adding graphics on the notes in the video 
* Animation of the graphics in the written components
* Create a more detailed Jupyter Notebook section

## Make a Scale App
## Jupyter Notebook Resources
## 1080 Fest

## Looking Forward
Future project ideas for the course next Fall:

* Diagraming the recorded lectures to group or "mark" them under overarching modules
* Look into using Google Collab for students to work together on Jupyter Notebooks
* Create "micro projects" to introduce students to certain tools (ex. a short guided project on Jupyter Notebook to make students more comfortable using Jupyter Notebook in their final project)
