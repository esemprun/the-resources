### Zoom

Tested by: Molly Peterson

###### Original Assessment

Pros:

Cons:

Academic Use:

###### Do you still use this tool?
  - Of course. It's the gold standard for formal, professional communications in the remote era. Students tend to avoid wanting to communicate via Zoom in their free time, however, because it is so rigidly associated with higher-pressure or less casual environments.

### Houseparty

Tested by: Elmer Vivas-Portillo, Sofi Andrade, Sam Benkelman, Molly Peterson, Abby McElroy

![houseparty icon](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1075405169104379905/oAb1WFs4_400x400.jpg)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Allows you to quickly jump in and out of conversations with your friends who are online
  - Offers games to play with the group (inc. Trivia, Quick Draw, Heads Up)
  - Can help people feel more comfortable contributing/taking up space in the conversation because the number of members is capped at eight (which doesn't happen as much on Zoom or other, larger conference tools)
  - Capable of running in the background of your computer indefinitely while you work--this feature can be utilized to facilitate people "dropping in" on each other, without having to share meeting times or coordinate, as long as they are friends in the app
  - Has a more casual, comfortable connotation than Zoom

Cons:
  - Does not allow screen share, despite its claims to the contrary
  - Limits conversation to eight members
  - Cannot provide the same structure as Zoom (for example, no Breakout Room function)
  - Can be unintuitive to add friends
  - Connection often fails on the computer for some users (there are fewer connectivity issues with the phone app)

Academic Use:
  - Icebreakers (especially the games)
  - Virtual "drop-in" settings like office hours
  - Casual study space for students that simulates the spontaneity of a library or d-hall
  - Quick discussions during class with a lot of mobility allowed between groups (unlike with Breakout Rooms on Zoom)

###### Do you still use this tool?
  - Though some students are still using Houseparty, the craze has largely died down, and many haven't used the platform in more than a month. One theory as to why is that, during the first few weeks of quarantining, students were still adjusting after the abrupt switch from spontaneous on-campus social environment to isolation, and were more energized to speak with less familiar faces online. As quarantine has gone on, however, and the memory of being on campus becomes more and more distant, the thought of connecting with a mere acquaintance or even a stranger on the fly starts to seem less and less comfortable.

### Squad

Tested by: Kylie Simms, Sophie Bauder

![squad logo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bushwickdaily.com/post_image-image/smuMO9kNBL8jfZlFZWFoOQ.png)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Allows screen share with friends while watching Youtube, TikTok, and Snapchat
  - Video chat continues while streaming; simultaneous video/audio streams (one being that of the online content, the other your friend's face/words)

Cons:
  - No mute button
  - Confusing user interface
  - Requires you to share contact info from your phone
  - Frequent glitches

Academic Use:
  - Inappropriate for class use because of the requirement to share phone contacts

###### Do you still use this tool?

### Flock Draw

Tested by: Tyler Johnston, Laura Frustaci

![flock draw logo](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/-lmX0AO3D4TpDXtLlQL7QRSHvBcD2g8fCg1GYL_Vt233e-sokiFHPxVQH7NXyyRJqyKj6p6idJ_bFDBKA-KmIBIhHg)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Runs fast with no glitches experienced by LLUFs so far
  - Provides a full set of colors and many brush sizes
  - Includes built-in text chat
  - Calming and creatively stimulating

Cons:
  - Site contains banner ads, which can be distracting
  - Has no undo button -- can really mess up a project of any consequence
  - Has no eyedropper tool

Academic Use:
  - Could be used for group diagramming or brainstorming in a visual mode
  - Art classes could put to good use sketching or drafting (though it seems unlikely this would be the medium of choice for a final project)
  - A good way to help students decompress--could take a break from lecture/discussion to let students doodle or visually synthesize together for a few minutes

###### Do you still use this tool?

### Club Penguin

Tested by: Yilan Yang, Mario Guiterrez-Rodriguez, Carlos Guiterrez

![club penguin penguin](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/club-penguin-rewritten/images/9/90/Black_on_a_Player_Card.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20170724224805)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Very fun and engaging, keeps user constantly involved
  - Provides different types of communication (penguin dance moves, text bubbles, emojis, postcards)
  - Numerous servers foster a broad, global community
  - Avatar and igloo are customizable, allowing users to showcase their personalities

Cons:
  - Minigames cannot be played with friends, must be undertaken individually
  - Does not allow for private messaging--all messages will be broadcasted to the whole server, guaranteeing strangers will see your message
  - Postcards, dance moves, and emojis are limited in their scope: they are not very customizable and fail to convey clear or complex information
  - Has potential to be extremely distracting
  - Messages don't last very long and chat history quickly exceeds its memory
  - Requires a lot of bandwidth

Academic Use:
  - Not a lot of practical academic use beyond levity or stress relief

### Google Docs

Tested by: Brenda Ceja, Jeremy Tsai

![google docs icon](https://www.pinclipart.com/picdir/big/378-3789173_google-docs-png-google-docs-app-icon-clipart.png)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Facilitates collaborative, simultaneous editing
  - Edits appear in real-time
  - Is easily accessible with an intuitive user interface
  - Has basic embed capabilities (photos, hyperlinks, videos)
  - Provides 3 different modes to toggle--view, comment, and edit--allowing control over user involvement capacities
  - Includes chat side bar (chatting is also easy in-document)
  - Saves automatically! Huge!
  - Can save changes offline, though these changes will be lost if the computer is turned off or dies before access to internet can be restored
  - Supports many Chrome extensions, such as Zotero, a citation generator and resource-saving cloud
  - Google Drive integration allows access to many other types of media/files and provides opportunity to organize projects across mediums

Cons:
  - Can lag when multiple users are editing the same file
  - Formatting errors can occur with simultaneous editing or when exporting document
  - Has no checks against freeloading, hard to determine which group members contributed what
  - Requires a reliable internet connection for most effective use

Academic Use:
  - Fast way to take notes
  - Study guide making/sharing
  - Group project work
  - Sharing documents
  - Taking minutes for student group meetings

###### Do you still use this tool?
  - Resolutely yes, Google Docs is essential for any student or collaborative person

### Google Hangouts

Tested by: Brenda Ceja, Jeremy Tsai

![google hangouts icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Hangouts_icon.svg/800px-Hangouts_icon.svg.png)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Is highly accessible--no sign-up cost or download necessary
  - Does not place time limits on calls (unlike Zoom, which will limit calls to 40 minutes outside of professional/educational accounts)
  - Intuitive user interface
  - Requires no personal information from user
  - Works on many devices, unlike Apple product-specific platforms like FaceTime and Houseparty
  - Little lagging and high resolution

Cons:
  - Fewer features than Zoom (e.g. no virtual backgrounds, breakout rooms, hand-raising functions)
  - Lack of virtual background feature specifically entails students who may not be comfortable sharing visual information about their home environment have no easy way to avoid doing so

Academic Use:
  - Student group projects outside of class (no phone number is required to make an account, a huge plus)
  - In-class or moderated needs would be better served by Zoom

###### Do you still use this tool?
  - Yes; many students have transitioned away from using Houseparty for their social needs to more intentional, controlled communication tools like Google Hangouts

### Discord

Tested by: Lara Teich, Julie Tassinari

![discord icon](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1260953366630264838/rqAiNASF_400x400.jpg)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Is free!
  - Very similar to Slack in facilitation of many project threads or group communication spaces
  - Has voice chat feature that allows you to easily speak in-person with members within a given channel (biggest difference from Slack)
  - Sends information about who is typing in real-times
  - Downloadable on many devices
  - Can be operated easily in an internet browser without download

Cons:
  - Has a stigma of catering primarily to "gamers"
  - Voice chat does not offer hierarchy control (for example, professors would not have the ability to mute students were they abusing the voice chat function)
  - Can be confusing when first getting started, though a help section is easily accessible and many online walkthroughs are available
  - Some functions are only available with a "Nitro" subscription (premium upgrade) of $9.99 a month--though the added features are more of fun bonuses than essentials

Academic Use:
  - Professors could make a free account on Discord and create a server for their whole class--TFs could be made co-administrators of the server by assigning them the responsibility in the server's "roles" section
  - Offers a more relaxed, accessible, and unified environment for classroom engagement than email or other analog methods of communication--it's nice to have everything in one place

###### Do you still use this tool?
  - Though our student testers have not used this tool since testing it, they have very positive opinions of the interface and affirm its potential as an educational tool. A big reason why they haven't used it since testing is that its functionality is best suited for communication between large numbers of people, which generally entails an initial effort to get everyone registered and an institutional commonality/unified mission among users.

### GroupMe

Tested by: Molly Peterson

![groupme icon](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7C5_TvMTP3asZu6qYmGGIwOn_s3SH_sCB0KdBhDXauzgSMsRapwoCeL55V4AKAauBIU)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Allows group messaging between users of all phone brands
  - Can be used as a phone app or on the computer
  - Syncs phone contacts for quick access
  - Notifications can be toggled--even provides the option of muting individual conversations
  - Individual and group avatars and names are customizable

Cons:
  - Requires wifi
  - Often glitchy for some users (failing to load messages, only partially syncing contact lists, etc.)
  - Offers little opportunity for hierarchical regulation

Academic Use:
  - Because GroupMe is not easily regulated, it is best used for communicating with students outside of a formal classroom context--for example, small tutorials with a strong interpersonal component could communicate via GroupMe
