![virtual communication](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FR-Hill-Global-Virtual-Team-Communication-1200.jpg)

LLUFs tested and reviewed different virtual communication tools at the start of the online semester. We are going to take a look at how their original assessments compare to their current opinions of these platforms--and find out which tools have stood the test of two months' time.

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Allows you to quickly jump in and out of conversations with your friends who are online
  - Offers games to play with the group (inc. Trivia, Quick Draw, Heads Up)
  - Can help people feel more comfortable contributing/taking up space in the conversation because the number of members is capped at eight (which doesn't happen as much on Zoom or other, larger conference tools)
  - Capable of running in the background of your computer indefinitely while you work--this feature can be utilized to facilitate people "dropping in" on each other, without having to share meeting times or coordinate, as long as they are friends in the app
  - Has a more casual, comfortable connotation than Zoom

Cons:
  - Does not allow screen share, despite its claims to the contrary
  - Limits conversation to eight members
  - Cannot provide the same structure as Zoom (for example, no Breakout Room function)
  - Can be unintuitive to add friends
  - Connection often fails on the computer for some users (there are fewer connectivity issues with the phone app)

Academic Use:
  - Icebreakers (especially the games)
  - Virtual "drop-in" settings like office hours
  - Casual study space for students that simulates the spontaneity of a library or d-hall
  - Quick discussions during class with a lot of mobility allowed between groups (unlike with Breakout Rooms on Zoom)

### Squad

Tested by: Kylie Simms, Sophie Bauder

![squad logo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bushwickdaily.com/post_image-image/smuMO9kNBL8jfZlFZWFoOQ.png)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Allows screen share with friends while watching Youtube, TikTok, and Snapchat
  - Video chat continues while streaming; simultaneous video/audio streams (one being that of the online content, the other your friend's face/words)

Cons:
  - No mute button
  - Confusing user interface
  - Requires you to share contact info from your phone
  - Frequent glitches

Academic Use:
  - Inappropriate for class use because of the requirement to share phone contacts

### Flock Draw

Tested by: Tyler Johnston, Laura Frustaci

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Runs fast with no glitches experienced by LLUFs so far
  - Provides a full set of colors and many brush sizes
  - Includes built-in text chat
  - Calming and creatively stimulating

Cons:
  - Site contains banner ads, which can be distracting
  - Has no undo button -- can really mess up a project of any consequence
  - Has no eyedropper tool

Academic Use:
  - Could be used for group diagramming or brainstorming in a visual mode
  - Art classes could put to good use sketching or drafting (though it seems unlikely this would be the medium of choice for a final project)
  - A good way to help students decompress--could take a break from lecture/discussion to let students doodle or visually synthesize together for a few minutes

### Club Penguin

Tested by: Yilan Yang, Mario Guiterrez-Rodriguez, Carlos Guiterrez

![club penguin penguin](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/club-penguin-rewritten/images/9/90/Black_on_a_Player_Card.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20170724224805)

###### Original Assessment

Pros:
  - Very fun and engaging, keeps user constantly involved
  - Provides different types of communication (penguin dance moves, text bubbles, emojis, postcards)
  - Numerous servers foster a broad, global community
  - Avatar and igloo are customizable, allowing users to showcase their personalities

Cons:
  - Minigames cannot be played with friends, must be undertaken individually
  - Does not allow for private messaging--all messages will be broadcasted to the whole server, guaranteeing strangers will see your message
  - Postcards, dance moves, and emojis are limited in their scope: they are not very customizable and fail to convey clear or complex information
  - Has potential to be extremely distracting
  - Messages don't last very long and chat history quickly exceeds its memory

Academic Use:
  -
