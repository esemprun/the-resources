## The Rationale: Why Pods?

#### Meet the Pod!
![shivi]()
Shivi is a Junior in Winthrop House (along with the wonderful Lila) studying Integrative Biology with a secondary in Economics. Born and raised in New Jersey, she has exchanged living by the Hudson River for the Charles River in Cambridge. At the Learning Lab, she loves thinking about intentional interaction and podcasts. When not at 50 Church Street, she can most often be found playing board games, trying new foods around the Square, or at the Harvard Ed Portal across the river where she is a mentor.

Lara Teich is a Junior in Kirkland House (with the Sunshine also known colloquially as Sophie) studying Government and East Asian studies. At the Learning lab, she loves to acquire new skills and teach the fabulous folks around her what she’s learned! Her passions include photography and other visual arts, curling, as well as song & dance & sweet romance, and happy endings happening by happenstance. (Credits to _Something Rotten_) 

![sophie]()
Sophie is a junior in Kirkland House (along with her beloved roommate Lara!) studying Integrative Biology, Earth & Planetary Sciences, and Spanish. She loves to sing with the Pitches, write and edit for _Satire V_, and excite in rocks with the Geological Society. In the Learning Lab, she loves learning new skills in Photoshop, photography, and Final Cut Pro and gaining as much computational competency as she can!  

![lila]()
Lila is a junior in Winthrop house studying Human Evolutionary Biology and Social Anthropology. She loves incorporating philosophical reflection and art making into her projects at the Learning Lab. Her favorite thing to do is sing with the Pitches (alongside Sophie and Sam!) and with Uchoir. She also enjoys teaching and mentoring at the Ed Portal. She is excited to be studying abroad next semester in Paris, but she will miss the fun, creative, chaotic energy of the Learning Lab while she is away!


#### Origin Story
One fateful day in September, we convened for the first time as a group and after about one minute of directed musing, we decided upon this name after Sophie exclaimed “Pod? As in Cephalopod?” and we were hence christened. So enamoured were we with this name that taken it upon ourselves to become the most spirited molluskan pod out there. 

#### Podjects
We are mapping the LL-- and all the ways in which it works. The fluidity of the space, as well as the diversity of people and activities, make for a rich landscape. From Color to Podcasting, we hope to create a theoretical framework for understanding simultaneously the big picture and the minutiae of the LL. This project takes the form of many mapping activities.

We started by mapping Color in the LL--its utility and its ubiquity in the Lab made it a helpful place to start. Traditional methods of mapping the color space have often involved circular shapes to describe a linear visual spectrum, and value and saturation force this color space to be three-dimensional. The reflections from our discussions surrounding the mapping of color space led to a workshop on Color in the LL, where we began making a Learning Lab Palette.

Next, we led a DesignLab workshop and mapped the relationship between the Physical and the Digital using cards, papers, and pipe cleaners. This was a fruitful workshop that allowed us to explore the merits and drawbacks of different forms of media, and contemplate philosophical questions about the nature of thought.

In addition to these and other narrowly focused mapping projects, we hope to create a “mega map” of the LL for the showcase. This map will encompass all of our previous maps, as well as offer a broader framework for conceptualizing the LL.
